                        Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, commonly known as Swatantryaveer Savarkar or simply Veer Savarkar in
                        Marathi language,
                        was an Indian independence activist and politician who formulated the Hindu nationalist
                        philosophy of Hindutva. He was a leading personality in the Hindu Mahasabha. Savarkar joined the
                        Hindu Mahasabha and popularized the term Hindutva (Hinduness), previously
                        coined by Chandranath Basu, to create a collective "Hindu" identity as an essence of Bharat
                        (India). Savarkar was an atheist and also a pragmatic practitioner of Hindu
                        philosophy.
