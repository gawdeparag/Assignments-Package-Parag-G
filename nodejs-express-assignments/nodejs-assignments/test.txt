Reichsführer John Smith was a former U.S Army Captain who joined the SS following the 
surrender of the United States. He quickly rose through the ranks to Obergruppenführer, 
and was assigned to investigate the American Resistance in New York.
John used to be fond of sailing, which was expressed with Rudolph Wegener saying he used to be out at sea 
as much as he was on land. However, after an event in Cincinnati, he stopped for yet unexplained reasons 
(However, in Season Three, it is revealed that many Jews were being murdered and killed in Cincinnati, 
by the Nazis).
